The goal of this project was to investigate how to integrate Tables data views with segues. Creating a very usual case
in which the user can interact with a list of things such as contacts, todo, tasks, reminders, etc.

1. One controller display a list (in a table) of options(strings), 
2. when the user clicks in one of them, the user move to the second controller and the 
title of this controller is updated with the clicked option in the first one
